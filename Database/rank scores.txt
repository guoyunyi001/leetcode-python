---check points: subquery in where clause; use of max

--- solution 1 best performance so far
--- logic: 1. find the number of salary smaller than the current salary
select score, 
      (select count(distinct score) 
        from scores 
	   where s.score <= score) rank
  from scores s
  order by score desc

--- solution 2 
--- logic: 1. first subquery to find the top n-1 salary
---        2. second subquery to find the (n-1)th hightest salary by choosing the minmum value in top n-1 salary
---        3. find the nth hightest salary by selecting the maximum salary which is smaller than the n-1 th hisghest salary
select s1.score,
  count(distinct s2.score) as rank
from scores s1
left join scores s2 on s2.score >= s1.score
group by s1.id
order by s1.score desc
